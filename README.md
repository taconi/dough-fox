This sample is taken from the default sample pack used by [FoxDot](https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot), a great live coding library made by Ryan Kirkbride.

Inspired by [Dough-Fox](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/Dough-Fox), but trying not to rename the samples.

```javascript
samples('github:taconi/dough-fox')

s("[V p O e]*2")
```
